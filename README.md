A simple userscript to provide an unintrusive horizontal navigation bar in similar style to the trending subreddits list on your personal frontpage.

Fully tested on Chromium and should be compatible with any browser with a 
userscript manager supporting ECMAScript 6.

## Installation
You will require a userscript manager extension installed on your browser. 
Violentmonkey is recommended for Chromium/Chrome and Firefox as it's an actively 
maintained open source implementation.

To install the script, simply open the [raw copy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSN190/MultiredditNav/master/multiredditnav.user.js) of the `multiredditnav.user.js` script and your userscript manager will take over from here.
